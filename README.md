# Bandgap Reference Circuit
The aim of this project is to design a Bandgap Reference Circuit which generates a constant,stable reference voltage independent to temperature variations.In any System on Chip(SoC) the need for reference voltage is imminent.In almost all the analog IP blocks like Analog to Digital Converters,Low Dropout Voltage Regulators etc require this Voltage.
# Installation steps for LTSpiceXVII Tool
The Design and Simulations of this Bandgap Reference Circuit are done using LTSpiceXVII Tool.The detailed steps for the installation of LTSpiceXVII tool are given below.

1.Click [here](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) to download the LTSpiceXVII Tool.

2.Click on `Download for Windows 7, 8 and 10` to get the `.exe` file for installation.

* 4.In the menu bar, click on `Simulate` and select `Edit Simulation Cmd`.
* 5.A transient analysis window is displayed.
* 6.Enter the values for `Stop Time`, `Time to start saving data` and `Maximum time step`.
* 7.A SPICE script of that transient analysis is obtained.Place it near the Schematic.
* 8.To do simulation at various temperatures,a SPICE directive is to be used which is present at the last of tool bar.
* 9.Write the command `.temp -40 -30 -10 20 40 50 80 110` in the SPICE directive and place it near the schematic.
* 10.In the menu bar,select `Simulate` and and click on `Run`.
* 11.A probe appears in the schematic window.Touch the probe on the wire at the Vref label on the schematic.
* 12.The waveforms at different temperatures are obtained.
