# Bandgap Reference Circuit
The aim of this project is to design a Bandgap Reference Circuit which generates a constant,stable reference voltage independent to temperature variations.In any System on Chip(SoC) the need for reference voltage is imminent.In almost all the analog IP blocks like Analog to Digital Converters,Low Dropout Voltage Regulators etc require this Voltage.
